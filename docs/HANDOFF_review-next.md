# Handoff: review -> gm (ship gate)

## Gate 12 — `build/context-ceiling-fail-closed` @ `eade98f`: **CLEARED** (2026-09-29 19:14 UTC)

Task: gm `msg_eebc70c2_8965730`. Full verdict of record: `msg_f07671e5_9255341` (no
`state/review/` dir for this one — the message body *is* the findings file). gm merged and pushed;
re-verified at boot: `eade98f` is an ancestor of `fork/fix-arturo-mapfile-bash32` via merge
`bba5cda`. gm is waiting on **build's Part 2**, which will arrive here as the next gate.

Verified, not taken on trust: the 1M ceiling is **empirically true** — 62 live transcripts exceed
200k input tokens, max observed 975,201 (opus-4-8), which is unreachable inside a 200k window. That
also proves the old bug was worse than "6.25× under-estimate": 975k against a 200k default computes
487% full, and the >100% guard then *discarded* exactly the seats at the wall. All 8 real model
strings in live use resolve (longest-prefix earns its keep: `claude-opus-5-5` and
`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` both resolve only by prefix), so fail-closed costs nothing today.
+12 tests exactly, 15 pre-existing env failures unchanged; mutation → 3 red, restored → 72 pass.

**One residual, non-blocking:** prefix matching is safe against an unknown *family* but not against a
known family that *shrinks* its window — a future `claude-opus-5-9` at 200k would silently inherit
1,000,000 and rotate that seat too late. Staleness risk is asymmetric (growth harmless, shrink
silent). Closable only by refreshing the table from the Models API, which the code comment already
names. Also: `claude-mythos-5` is the one table row I could not corroborate — harmless if it doesn't
exist.

## ✅ READ FIRST — everything else from 2026-09-29 is CLOSED. Nothing is owed by this seat.

The supervisor was restarted 16:12:32 and **all five restart-gated changes were verified live** (by
gm, then independently re-verified by me — see below). Nothing from today is merged-but-dormant.

| # | Change | Verified live |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | access log `fc55a89` | `[access …] addr=127.0.0.1 … x-orchestra-user="eve"` emitted on demand — it records the *spoofed claim*, which is the A09 blind spot actually closed |
| 2 | router `b834241`+F1+F5+F6 | fresh pid @ 16:12:32 under **Python 3.12**; all four markers on disk |
| 3 | TMUX-strip `df92625` | supervised daemon env has **zero** `TMUX*` vars (this one was absent from gm's set — I checked it) |
| 4 | session_index beat `d4725b9` | mtime `16:14:32` → `16:18:32`, two clean 120 s intervals — proved **cycling**, not a one-shot |
| 5 | agents-live-status `3383805` | `review: status=working source=transcript` — the override was caught **correcting my own status** in live traffic |

Also live: API bound `127.0.0.1:8888` only (LAN refused), identity spoof inert
(`X-Orchestra-User: eve` → `operator`, `trusted:false`).

**Two classes closed on evidence, not assertion.** The reduced-motion sweep: exactly 10 bare loop
classes remain and they are precisely the agreed transient typing/loading dots — zero persistent.
The PEP 604 interpreter split: all four files carry `from __future__ import annotations`, and
`scripts/test_pep604_annotations.py` is a repo-wide AST guard I mutation-tested (reintroduce the
pattern → red). `pytest scripts` went from **aborting entirely** (`Interrupted: 1 error during
collection`) to **2889 passing**, with 18 pre-existing environment failures confirmed identical
before and after.

**PR #133** (`main <- fix-arturo-mapfile-bash32`, Tulum-DAO, 100 commits) is **fully pushed**
(`0 0` vs its remote). Waiting only on a merge click; gm lacks merge rights.

**Still open, none of it this seat's to drive:** Cloudflare dashboard confirm on tunnel
`43f26a47-9bc1-43c3-80ab-6222a44daac4` (the only control holding that vector shut — a loopback bind
does **not** close it, cloudflared dials its origin over loopback); rotate the tunnel token (readable
from root's argv via `ps`); **ntfy push is down** — config gap (`~/.config/jarvis/` does not exist),
the integration is deprecated per `docs/REFERENCE_INSTALL.md` (one-way, answered **0 of 628**
decisions), and cards still reach Telegram with working buttons, so **do not revive it** — the one
thing worth doing there is making the failure durable, since it currently only hits the stderr of
whoever ran `approval.py`.

**Two known-broken things that are NOT bugs, so nobody re-investigates them:** the detector reports
`idle` for provably-working seats (real, unfixed, deliberately not root-caused from a UI ticket — the
transcript corroboration masks it); and ~18 `scripts/` tests fail on this machine for environment
reasons (tmux/process-spawn reapers, a CPU-steady-state assert, macOS `/tmp` resolution, absent
`pytest-asyncio`) — identical count before and after today's work, so they are not regressions.

**Today's records:** `$ORCHESTRA_DIR/state/review/router-offset-b834241/` (router P0 + F1/F5/F6, the
API security incident, the cso baseline) and `$ORCHESTRA_DIR/state/review/ship-2026-09-29/` (the ship
report, session-index and CI-coverage gates). Eleven gates and one ship today; every verdict is in
those two directories.

---

- **Lineage:** build -> review (Gen 2)
- **Timestamp:** 2026-09-29T10:45:00Z
- **Working Directory:** /Users/flybyflow/orchestraos
- **Reviewed:** branch `build/router-offset-commit-then-confirm` @ **`b834241`** (the P0 fix commit only — the branch carries 25 commits; the other 24 were not in scope for this gate)
- **Findings file:** `$ORCHESTRA_DIR/state/review/router-offset-b834241/findings.md`
- **Task:** gm `msg_52d5354a_78316399` — ship gate before merge + restart of live router pid 10767

## 1. Verdict

**CLEARED to merge and restart — CONDITIONAL on the §1a deploy gate below passing.**

The code is cleared. The *deploy* is not cleared until §1a is walked, because the working tree
that actually feeds the live process does not currently contain the fix. A sign-off that stops at
"the merge looks good" would be a green light over a silently-still-broken deploy — the exact
failure class this commit exists to kill.

## 1a. DEPLOY GATE — mandatory, walk it in order, immediately before and after the restart

Folded in at gm's request (`msg_1567b7d7_78676841`), and independently confirmed by me before
writing this. **Current state, re-verified 2026-09-29T10:47Z:**

```
branch:                             fix-arturo-mapfile-bash32
git merge-base --is-ancestor b834241 HEAD   ->  NO      # tree does NOT contain the fix
grep -c MAX_UPDATE_ATTEMPTS plugins/telegram/router.py  ->  0   # on-disk file is the OLD code
live pid 10767 started              Tue Sep 29 08:57:58 2026   # predates b834241 (10:35)
<data>/state/telegram/              chat-id, notified.json, offset   # no last-done
```

The shared checkout was switched to another branch mid-session, so `b834241` is safe in git but
absent from disk. Restarting right now would relaunch the **old, buggy** router.

1. **Merge** `b834241` into the branch the working tree actually has checked out (or switch the
   tree to a branch containing it). Merging to `main` alone does nothing for pid 10767.
2. **Confirm the checkout contains the fix:**
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor b834241 HEAD && echo CONTAINS-FIX` → must print `CONTAINS-FIX`.
3. **Confirm on disk, immediately before the restart** (this is the step that catches a
   mid-session branch switch, which git-level checks alone will not):
   `grep -c MAX_UPDATE_ATTEMPTS plugins/telegram/router.py` → must be **≥ 1**. It is `0` right now.
4. **Confirm the running process actually picked it up, after the restart:**
   - new pid ≠ `10767`, and `ps -p <newpid> -o lstart=` postdates the merge;
   - then have the operator send **one** message and check that
     **`<data>/state/telegram/last-done` now exists** — that file does not exist today and the old
     code can never create it, so its appearance is positive proof the new code is the one running.
     `offset` alone proves nothing; both versions write it.

Do not report the deploy as done on steps 1–2 alone. Steps 3 and 4 are the ones that fail loudly
when the trap has been stepped in.

### Gate status — last re-checked 2026-09-29T10:51Z

| Step | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1. merge | **PASS** | `7109aaa` "Merge branch 'build/router-offset-commit-then-confirm'" on `fix-arturo-mapfile-bash32` (gm merged it) |
| 2. `--is-ancestor` | **PASS** | prints `CONTAINS-FIX` |
| 3. grep on disk | **PASS** | returns `5` (was `0` pre-merge) — **but re-run it at the literal last second before the restart; this tree is shared and unstable** |
| 4. process picked it up | **PASS — closed 2026-09-29T11:56:50Z** | pid 10767 gone; router is now **pid 3445, started 11:22:59**. `last-done` appeared at 11:56:50 — a file only the fixed code can create. Detail below. |

### Step 4 closed — P0 verified in production, not just in the harness

Two operator messages landed at 11:56, and all three P0 properties are observable on real traffic:

```
last-done = 589340061          (mtime 11:56:50)
offset    = 589340062          (mtime 11:56:50)
msg_store rows:  tg-589340061  11:56:50   "And make sure you follow the ontology of…"
                 tg-589340060  11:56:18   "Thank you for sending back the latest up…"
```

1. **`last-done` exists at all** → the new code path executed. The old code cannot create this file.
2. **`offset == last_done + 1`** → commit-then-confirm's invariant holds live.
3. **One row per `update_id`, keyed `tg-<update_id>`** → the idempotency key working on real traffic;
   two updates in, two rows out, no gap and no duplicate.
4. **No `escalate` row and no `dropped` metadata from `telegram`** → `_alert_stepped_over` never
   fired; nothing was stepped over.

Minor correction to gm's read of the same evidence: `last-done 589340061` pairs with **`tg-589340061`**,
not `tg-589340060` (off by one). The substance is unaffected and the actual evidence is *stronger* than
a single message — two consecutive updates were both delivered with matching ids.

**Still not deployed: F6.** pid 3445 started 11:22:59; F6's merge (`6816ad0`) landed 11:26:36, so the
running process is **P0 + F1 + F5 only**, by design ("rides the next natural restart"). The on-disk
file *does* contain F6, so a `grep` of `router.py` today would wrongly suggest F6 is live — check pid
3445's start time against 11:26:36 instead. Disk is currently **ahead of** the process, the inverse of
the trap in §1a.

**The verdict transfers to what will actually run:**
`git diff b834241 HEAD -- plugins/telegram/router.py plugins/telegram/test_router_offset.py` is
**empty** — the merge altered the reviewed code by zero bytes — and the post-merge tree passes
**27/27**. No re-review is needed after the merge.

Blocked on: the operator's go-ahead for the brief channel interruption (gm asked, not yet
answered). gm will ping review for a second pair of eyes on step 4 after restarting.

One required follow-up (F1), two notes (F2/F3), one accepted-as-designed (F4) — all recorded in
the findings file, none of them worth leaving the live process on the buggy code for. Today every
operator *text* message on the fleet's only command channel is destroyed silently by any
transient failure; this commit fixes that, and I verified the fix works rather than taking
build's word for it.

## 1b. Second gate — F1 fix `a062d57` (`build/telegram-attachment-placeholder`): **CLEARED**

Task: gm `msg_54e5f57c_79450344`. Findings:
`$ORCHESTRA_DIR/state/review/router-offset-b834241/findings-f1-a062d57.md`.
Merge target `fix-arturo-mapfile-bash32`; no restart decision needed — it rides along on the next
router restart. Based on `7109aaa` (`--is-ancestor` YES), so it applies on top of the merged P0.

I proposed this fix in the P0 review, so I tried to break it rather than confirm it:

- **F1 is genuinely closed** — re-ran **my own original reproduction** (the harness that found the
  bug), not build's tests: photo-only message, no caption, `fetch` raises. Was `delivered: 0`;
  now **`delivered: 1`** with body `Attachments:\n  photo: [download failed — ask the operator to
  resend]`. The reproduction no longer reproduces.
- **`plugins/` suite: 30 passed** (27 existing + 3 new) — matches build.
- **Mutation claim reproduced exactly** — stubbing out the failure-recording branch turns **2 of
  the 3** new tests red; the third is the happy-path guard, which correctly stays green because the
  mutation doesn't touch it. Restored → 30 pass.
- **F4 undisturbed** — `router.py:305` `download_file(obj["file_id"], ...)` is unchanged, so
  `photo: [{}]` still raises `KeyError` *before* the download and is still TRANSIENT → step-over.
- Compiles under the live Python 3.12.13. `msg_id` derivation untouched → the P0's exactly-once
  guarantee is unaffected. The only newly-delivered messages are ones previously discarded silently.
- **Agreed with build's call not to raise on download failure** — raising would recover a transient
  blip but head-of-line block the channel for the full attempt budget on a permanently unfetchable
  file (>20 MB Bot API limit). Build named the trade-off and corrected the P0 commit's overclaim
  rather than quietly widening scope.

**F5 — NEW, out of scope, gm to scope separately.** Same symptom as the P0, different cause:
the attachment loop enumerates only `photo, document, voice, video, audio`, so a message whose only
content is an unenumerated kind never attempts a download, has no failure to record, and hits
`if not text: return`. Verified — `sticker`, `animation` (GIF) and `video_note` (round video) all
give `delivered=0 offset=701 warned=0`, i.e. silent drop. Pre-existing in both commits, not a
regression. Cheap fix in the same spirit: when a message yields no text *and* no attachments at all,
deliver an "(unsupported message type — resend as text)" placeholder instead of returning silently.
That closes the last silent-drop path I can find in `handle_message`. Not proposing enumerating
every Bot API media kind — that list grows; the catch-all covers it permanently.

F2 and F3 remain open and non-blocking, unchanged by this commit.

## 1c. Third gate — F5 fix `649cb44` (`build/telegram-unsupported-placeholder`): **CLEARED**

Task: gm `msg_6df0cc87_80058153`. Findings:
`$ORCHESTRA_DIR/state/review/router-offset-b834241/findings-f5-649cb44.md`.
Stacked on F1's `a062d57` (`--is-ancestor` YES); merge target `fix-arturo-mapfile-bash32`.

- **F5 is genuinely closed** — re-ran **my own F5 reproduction**: `sticker`, `animation`,
  `video_note` all now `delivered=1` with `(unsupported message type: <kind> — resend as text)` and
  `meta["unsupported"]` set. Was `delivered=0`, no signal.
- **`plugins/` suite: 38 passed** — matches build. Compiles under the live Python 3.12.13.
- **Mutation claim reproduced exactly** — restoring the bare `return` turns **6 of 8** red (the 5
  parametrised kinds + the naming test). The 2 staying green are the guards, correctly unaffected.
- **F1/F5 don't double-report** — a failed photo download delivers the F1 placeholder only, with
  `attachment_failures` and no `unsupported`. Ordinary text passes through verbatim.
- The reflection approach (`set(msg) - _ENVELOPE_KEYS`) is right and keeps the anti-rot property: an
  unknown future Bot API kind gets *reported*, never dropped, so a stale key set degrades the
  wording and nothing else.

**On gm's flagged service-message concern — agreed, and the exposure is smaller than the flag
implies.** (1) This is a 1:1 private DM, so the group-only service messages
(`new_chat_members`, `left_chat_member`, `group_chat_created`, `new_chat_title`, `video_chat_*`,
`forum_topic_*`, …) **cannot occur at all**; what stays reachable is essentially `pinned_message`
and `message_auto_delete_timer_changed`, both operator-initiated and rare (verified: a
`pinned_message` yields exactly one row). (2) `router.py:469` passes
`allowed_updates=["message","callback_query"]`, so `edited_message`/`my_chat_member`/`chat_member`
never arrive. **And the dangerous version of "new traffic" is absent — no feedback loop:** the bot's
own outgoing sends, including `_alert_stepped_over` warnings and pushed cards, are not echoed back
through `getUpdates`, so a placeholder cannot beget placeholders. Right trade, and not
pre-emptively suppressing is also right — guessing which service messages matter recreates the
rotting enumeration this commit removed.

**F6 — NEW, out of scope, gm to scope.** Same structural pattern that produced F1 and F5: *the guard
only fires when `text` is empty.* Add a caption to an unsupported kind and the media vanishes
unmentioned. Verified: `animation + caption` → delivers `look at this bug`; `video_note + caption` →
`urgent, see this`; neither carries `unsupported` or `attachment_failures`. **Not a regression** —
identical pre-F1/pre-F5 — and milder than F1/F5 since the operator's words do arrive. But it
misleads in a way a pure drop does not: gm reads "urgent, see this" with nothing to see. Cheap fix
(~3 lines): compute `kinds` **unconditionally** and *append* a named line the way F1 appends its
failure line, instead of only substituting for empty text. That collapses F1/F5/F6 into one rule —
anything the router could not render gets named in the body — and removes the seam that has now
produced three findings in a row.

F2 and F3 remain open and non-blocking, unchanged.

## 1d. Fourth gate — F6 consolidating fix `cfc420c` (`build/telegram-name-unrendered-always`): **CLEARED**

Task: gm `msg_a3be1126_80839422`. Findings:
`$ORCHESTRA_DIR/state/review/router-offset-b834241/findings-f6-cfc420c.md`.
Stack: P0 `b834241` → F1 `a062d57` → F5 `649cb44` (merged) → F6 `cfc420c`.

**Correction to my own F6 finding — build was right.** I framed F6 as "the same seam that produced
F1 and F5". F1 was never gated on `if not text:` — it used `if lines:` and appended, so caption +
failed download already named the photo pre-F6. Verified on the merged code:
`caption + FAILED photo` → `see this crash \n\n Attachments: \n photo: [download failed — …]`. So F6
was **specific to F5**, and "three findings in a row from one seam" overstated it. The finding's
substance was right; the attribution wasn't. (One nuance the other way: F5 didn't *introduce* the gap
either — pre-F5 that case also delivered the caption alone. F6 is an **incompleteness in F5's fix**.)

- **F6 is genuinely closed** — re-ran **my own two repro cases**: `animation + caption` and
  `video_note + caption` now append `  <kind>: [unsupported type — resend as text]` with
  `meta["unsupported"]` set. Both previously delivered the caption alone.
- **No double-labelling** — the risk this consolidation creates, and it's handled: `caption + FAILED
  photo` names the photo **once**, as a download failure only, never also "unsupported". `handled.add(key)`
  fires right after `if not obj: continue`, so an enumerated key counts as handled whether its
  download succeeded or failed, and `set(msg) - _ENVELOPE_KEYS - handled` excludes it. Right decomposition.
- **Mixed message** (photo + sticker + caption): each outcome named exactly once, no overlap in `meta`.
- **Guards hold** — plain text passes through undecorated; an envelope-only message still yields
  `(unsupported message type — resend as text)` with `meta["unsupported"]=['unknown']`.
- **`plugins/` suite: 45 passed**; mutation reproduces exactly (**5 red** when re-gated behind
  `if not text` — the 4 parametrised caption kinds + the mixed-message test); compiles under 3.12.13.

Nit, no action: the new comment inherits my overstatement ("three findings in a row"). If the file is
touched again, "F5's blind spot" is the accurate wording.

**With F6 merged I know of no remaining silent-drop path in `handle_message`.** F2 and F3 remain open
and non-blocking.

## 2. Verified independently (not from build's report)

- **Bug is real and still live:** `plugins/telegram/router.py:323` in the main checkout advances
  the offset outside the `try/except`. `ps -p 10767` → Python **3.12.13** running that exact file,
  which has no `MAX_UPDATE_ATTEMPTS`/`last_done` → still old code.
- **`plugins/` suite: 27 passed** at `b834241` in a clean worktree (Python 3.9.6) — matches build.
- **Mutation claim reproduced exactly:** reintroducing the unconditional advance turns **6 red,
  21 pass**; the 6 are the ones build named. Restored → 27 pass.
- **Exactly-once under the worst crash:** deleted **both** `offset` and `last-done` (router has no
  memory of the update at all), let Telegram redeliver from 0 → **one row, `tg-77`**. The
  store-level `tg-<update_id>` dedupe, not the offset file, is the real guarantee. It holds.
- **`msg_store` API the fix needs exists:** `send(..., msg_id=)` and `get(msg_id)`.
- **Under the live 3.12 interpreter:** compiles and imports, shape classifier behaves as
  documented. **pytest is not installed on 3.12** — so build's "compiled and smoke-tested under
  3.12" is precisely worded; nobody has run the suite on the live interpreter, me included.

## 3. Open Loops

- [ ] **F1 (required follow-up, NOT a merge blocker).** The "attachment fetch error" case the
  commit message lists as fixed is **still a silent permanent loss**. `download_file` swallows its
  own exception and returns `None`, so a photo-only message (no caption) whose fetch fails never
  raises → `if not text: return` → `poll_once` sees success → offset advances past it. Reproduced:
  `delivered 0, offset 91→92, attempts 0, operator warned: []`. Pre-existing and identical in the
  old code, so not a regression — but the commit message overstates coverage. Small fix: when an
  attachment object existed but `path` is `None`, append a placeholder line so the message still
  reaches gm (preferred), or raise so commit-then-confirm retries it.
- [ ] **F2 (note).** The 5-attempt budget buys **~22 ms measured** (~0.5–1.5 s in production), not
  a real outage window: `run()` has no backoff and `getUpdates` returns immediately while an update
  is pending. Weaker than it first looks — `msg_store` sets `busy_timeout=30000`, so the likeliest
  blip (sqlite lock contention) blocks in-call instead of raising and never touches the budget.
  Exposed class is fast-raising environment failures. `time.sleep(min(2 ** n, 30))` closes it.
- [ ] **F3 (note).** `_alert_stepped_over` writes gm's critical row through the same `msg_store`
  whose failure likely caused the step-over, so that signal goes missing exactly when it's needed
  (hit this in my harness; the code logs and continues, correctly). The operator warning rides
  Telegram, an independent path, and worked in every probe — loudness survives where it counts.
- [ ] **F4 (accepted, no action).** `photo: [{}]` → `KeyError('file_id')` is classified TRANSIENT
  and burns all 5 attempts before a loud step-over. Verified; safe outcome. Deliberately NOT
  widening `unprocessable_reason` — each shape check added there is a new chance to misclassify a
  transient failure as permanent, and that direction loses messages.

## 4. Decisions Made & Rationale

1. **CLEARED rather than NOT CLEARED despite F1.** F1 is a pre-existing sibling case, byte-identical
   in the old code, and holding the merge would keep the live router destroying the operator's text
   messages — the more common and more important path. Fixing F1 is a follow-up commit, not a gate.
2. **Answered gm's question on bounded-retry-then-escalate: the design is right.** Retry-forever on
   the only command channel is strictly worse — one poison update blocks every later approval. The
   seam (shape → permanent/never retried, effect → transient/never confirmed) is drawn correctly,
   and `unprocessable_reason` inspecting *only* shape is the load-bearing asymmetry that keeps a
   store outage from being misread as malformed. My one change is F2's backoff, which tunes the
   budget, not the design.
3. **Reviewed `b834241` alone, not the 25-commit branch.** That is what the gate was asked about.
   The other 24 commits have not been reviewed by this seat and this verdict says nothing about them.

## 5. Declared First Effect

Run **§1a step 3** — `grep -c MAX_UPDATE_ATTEMPTS plugins/telegram/router.py` — and do not touch
pid 10767 until it returns ≥ 1. It returns `0` as of this writing, so the very first action is the
merge in §1a step 1, not the restart.

## 6. Next 3 Immediate Actions

1. gm: get the operator's go-ahead for the brief channel interruption, then walk **§1a steps 1–2**
   (land `b834241` into the branch the main working tree has checked out, not just `main`).
2. Whoever restarts: **§1a steps 3–4** — grep on disk before `kill`, then new-pid check and confirm
   `last-done` appears in `<data>/state/telegram/` after the operator's first message.
3. build: F1 follow-up commit (attachment-fetch placeholder) + optionally F2's one-line backoff.

## 7. Grounding Canary Questions (Questions Only — No Answers!)

1. **Q1:** Which two state files did review delete to prove exactly-once survives a crash where the
   router retains no memory of the update, and what single row id came back (jsonl regarding the
   probe2 harness run against the real msg_store)?
2. **Q2:** How many tests went red under review's own mutation, and which branch of `poll_once` was
   mutated to produce that (jsonl regarding the independent mutation check)?
3. **Q3:** What measured wall-clock number did the 5-attempt budget survive for, and which
   `msg_store` PRAGMA is the reason that number is less alarming than it looks (jsonl regarding F2)?
4. **Q4:** Which function's internal `try/except` is the reason the commit's claimed
   "attachment fetch error" coverage does not actually exist (jsonl regarding F1's reproduction)?
5. **Q5:** Why does merging `b834241` to `main` alone fail to deploy the fix to pid 10767 (jsonl
   regarding the `ps -p 10767` read and the main checkout's current branch)?

## Superseded: prior verdict of record (Gen 1, 2026-09-20) — duelo-de-dibujo

Kept for lineage only; consumed by Test long ago. Branch `build/arabic-letter-tracing-vertical`
@ `86fca3e` in `/Users/flybyflow/duelo-de-dibujo`: **CLEARED**, no blocking findings, two
Test-stage open items (real-Claude `qa-judge.mjs` cases needing a Production-scoped
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; real-kid playtest + RTL/TTS + watch video `fKwOMa3r1_c`). Full detail in
git history of this file at `231f1d0` and earlier.
